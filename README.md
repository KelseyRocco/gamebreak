# üéÆGamebreaküïπÔ∏è
Gamebreak is a web application that allows you to discover and track your video games. 

This was a group project created by [Angela Choi](https://github.com/angelamchoi) and [Kelsey Rocco](https://github.com/KelseyRocco). 

## Inspiration
We wanted to share our love of video games with the world. Video games allowed us to problem solve by experimenting various solutions. It has taught us to take risks, fail, and most importantly to keep going and not give up. We are on a mission to help everyone find their favorite video game.

## Planning Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Entity Relationship Diagram
ERD can be found [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/29ba2d8e-8464-40bf-b81c-e8fd676560dd/edit?page=0_0#)
- The ERD helped us to create and structure our models and deeply think about their relationships such as one to many, many to one, or many to many. 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£User Stories
The Trello board for user stories, product roadmap, and tasks can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/YdIWpqHE/gamebreak).
- User stories allowed us to understand and delve deeper into a users' position and how the user would interact if the user would be using our platform. Throughout every planning stage, we ensured to always put the user in mind when crafting our web application.

- Creating mockups were incredibly useful, especially when we were mapping out routing for various pages. 

## Reflection / Difficulties Faced
‚ù§Ô∏èThings we enjoyed:
1. Incoporating our ideas 
- If either us of had an idea we ran it by each other and took ownership and did our best to execute it. 
2. Front-end & Back-end
- We both took turns working on front-end and back-end
3. Pair programming 
- We both learned so much from each other. We would teach other when we solved something differently or added something new.

‚õ∞Ô∏èDifficulties Faced: 
- Centered everything around games rather than systems
- Models & migrations 
- Filtering
- Github and resolving git conflicts

üìöLessons Learned:

1. Teamwork makes the dream work
- Your coding and problem solving skills go further when working together in a team environment
- Encountered more problems, but also learned how to solve them quicker 

2. Take more risks
- At first we were scared to push anything on to our main branch. Later on we realized that we can always retrieve our previous work, so we began to experiment freely. 

3. Prioritization
- We had an endless list of bugs and new features we wanted to implement occuring simultaneously. We decided to reprioritize and not include the store model and focus on games and systems.  .

4. Documenting our technical issues
- We encountered several technical issues. We began to document our technical issues for future reference and in case one of our teammates encounters it. The following are the technical issues we problem solved. 

    - Migration issues 
    - Git conflicts
    - Integrity error
    - Working with databases in SQL


## Next Steps
The following are the next step in improving our application:

- Incorporate games API to discover games by various systems
- Community section for people to share/borrow games
- Profile page
